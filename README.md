# Secret Santa Assigner

Allows a group of friends to determine who gets who in Secret Santa without even meeting up. Provided nobody looks.

1. Create `names.txt`.
2. Enter all the names of the people to be matched up, entirely in ASCII lowercase (no spaces), seperated by single newlines.
3. Run `generate.py`.
4. The person along with their assignment and the global vigenere key used to cipher their names is in `result.txt`.
